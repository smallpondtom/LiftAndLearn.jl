# Lift And Learn

## Overview
The Lift and Learn method offers a transformative approach to model reduction in nonlinear dynamical systems, especially those not conforming to polynomial structures. 

## Lifting Process
This method introduces an auxiliary variable, effectively 'lifting' the system into a polynomial framework. This direct transformation contrasts with Koopman theory's approximation approach, streamlining the representation of complex dynamics.

## Operator Inference
After lifting, the system is compatible with the Operator Inference scheme, facilitating the discovery of simplified models through data-driven techniques. This phase is instrumental in deriving interpretable and efficient reduced-order models from intricate dynamical systems.
